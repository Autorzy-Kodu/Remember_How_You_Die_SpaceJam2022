# Remember How You Die

First person, shooter game prototype created for Space Jam 2022 organized by JU Gamedev Students Association science club.

## Description

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger... Well in this game even death makes you stronger...

You have little time, you are in a very short loop from which the only way out is to beat all the opponents as fast as possible... Don't linger because the loop is short but don't worry, memory is your friend, memorize the position of the opponents to complete the loop even faster so as to finally be able to escape from the loop
